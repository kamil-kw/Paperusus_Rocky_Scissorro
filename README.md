# Rocky Paperusus Scissorro ⛰️🧻✂️ The Ultimate Turnament 

# Introduction

Welcome to my second Full Stack Course project. This game is a modern twist on the popular game rock paper scissor. 

In this project my goal was to create intresting game - with original approach to rock paper scissor topic. As a Quality Engineer I'm a person who look for improvements opportunity in my daily basis, therefore I'm always keeping in back of my head words of **Ty Warner** (CEO of Ty Icn.) ***"Even perfection has room for improvement"***, what in case of my game can be translated as a perfect game with funny twist as improvement. 

Hope You will enjoy my project idea, and have lots of fun with.

# 1. UX

As a part of my path of becoming a software developer from zero to hero 😊, I'm presenting a Rock Paperusus Scissorro game.

As mentioned in my first project my ultimate goal is to change my career path and become a full time developer, therefore my second project will be showing my new acquired skill which is JavaScript in the real project. 

One of the goals in this product was to draw attention of my potential employeers into this project and not be another one of the "next" rock paper scissors game out there, therefore I decided to use my creativity and build something new and original which can stay in memory for longer time than just simple version of this game.
