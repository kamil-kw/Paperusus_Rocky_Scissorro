            <p>He may look inconspicuously, but he wields a hammer as no one before. 
                In the far east countries he learned how to combat with the hammer, 
                and he is second to none. With one stroke he can break down the biggest 
                and toughest rocks in the world. His eternal enemy is Scissorro.</p>
