            <p>Slightly thick-skinned, was born with extraordinary ability to dull 
                sharp tools with his own skin.  His eternal enemy is Paperusus â€“ 
                Master of the hammer art.</p>

            <p>He may look inconspicuously, but he wields a hammer as no one before. 
                In the far east countries he learned how to combat with the hammer, 
                and he is second to none. With one stroke he can break down the biggest 
                and toughest rocks in the world. His eternal enemy is Scissorro.</p>
